# Introduction
Source code for my analyses of Senate roll calls. Currently, only the most basic ideal point analyses are implemented.

# Ideal Point Hardcoding
To resolve the inherent indeterminacy between assigning Republicans positive numbers and Democrats positive numbers, Senator Coburn (R OK) has been assigned a hardcoded ideal point of 2. Until I find a better solution, I am holding off estimating ideal points for earlier congresses.

# Data Sources
All of the roll call data comes from [VoteView](http://voteview.com/). If you use their data, please cite them, because their remarkable efforts are what makes it possible to analyze roll call records so easily.
